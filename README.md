# Doodle-jump-game

This is my first semester project that utilizes basic concepts of Programming Fundamentals, SFML and file handling.

It uses file handling to keep a check of scores and updates them whenever a highscore is made.
SFML is used for the graphics, score display, movement and display in general.

You will have to link the SFML library to your IDE first in order to run this project.

I have also included all the resources (ie sounds, images and text fonts) that I used to develop this project.
